Python implementation of tutorial paper "Transfer learning for motor imagery based brainâ€“computer interfaces: A tutorial" [Neural Netw. 2022] by Prof. Dongrui Wu.

Original Matlab implementation at  [`drwuHUST/TLBCI`](https://github.com/drwuHUST/TLBCI)

For those who are interested in deep learning TL approaches, refer to [`sylyoung/DeepTransferEEG`](https://github.com/sylyoung/DeepTransferEEG)

Currently, EA, CSP, LDA, EEGNet are implemented, in cross-subject unsupervised transfer.
